## About Flutter
It is the present day's popular one library for almost all platform app develpment like Android ( ~60% market share), Iphone ( ~30% ). More less one flutter dev can create the app once and it can be built into any of the target architecture.

## About Dart
Dart is a modern programming strictly typed language with AOT compilation like js in development and JIT for production ( as it takes more time ) compiled to native code like most strictly typed languages do. It supports single inheritance.

## Requrements
1. Android studio with one virtual device, ( required only if developing for Android otherwise host OS can be selected as well ) preferably installed in non OS drive.
2. Flutter sdk and Dart sdk which can be installed from the VSCode `Flutter` plugin itself. Select a different drive than the root folder is preferred for disk issues.
